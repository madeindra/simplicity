Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organizational sites. It's often used for GitHub Pages due to its seamless integration.

## Why Use Jekyll?

There are several reasons why Jekyll is a popular choice for static site generation:

- **Simplicity:** Write your content as markdown files, and Jekyll will transform it into a full-fledged website.
- **Performance:** Static sites generated by Jekyll are fast and efficient because they do not rely on server-side processing.
- **Customization:** Jekyll is highly customizable with themes, plugins, and front matter variables.
- **Version Control:** By storing your Jekyll site in a Git repository, you can track changes easily.
